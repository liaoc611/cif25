    <p>i arrive in <span>new york</span> and there's no place to go. 
            i'm ten days early with nothing to do with my hands, with just one carry-on after a 17-hour flight. 
            there's a slight drizze and, as always, someone i'm waiting for. 
            for whom, i'm not entirely sure-- anyone who will come?</p>
        <p>
            it's not so dim for <span>new york</span> tonight; in this perfect world, someone's installed the streetlights that line every pavement in <span>shanghai</span> here. 
            the street glows a warm orange. the puddles glisten, and it's finally not such a cold winter.
            i sit down on the patio of my building watching people come and go. a chinese girl-- a toddler, barely six or seven, sits down at my side, leaning her head on me. 
            her hair is brunette, soft and wispy. she's just breathing next to me, not saying anything. she has big eyes and pigtails, like me in that childhood photo on the subway.
            this slice of silence, clean and clear between us, muffles the background noise of the city. 
        </p>
        <p>
            suddenly her mother shows up and tugs at her, giving me an apologetic look.
            "i'm sorry," she says to me, then to the kid, "let's leave her alone. i'm sure she's busy..."
        </p>
        <p>
            i'm not busy. it was nice to have her company if only for a second.
        </p>
        <p>
            people i used to know carry duffel bags and emerge from the warm, huffing mouth of a subway station. 
            whoever i'm waiting for, i know he's not coming, so i walk into the subway station. someone i promised a coffee to smiles pleasantly at me, his aging face crinkling like a big sheet of parchment paper.
            he's tanner than i remember, blonder too. i wonder what i'll look like when i get older. 
        </p>
        <p>
            "headed to the airport?" he says jovially. "happy holidays." i said, i don't really know. the city is pleasant as of tonight, and now that the feeling of resignation has settled in and scraped out the desperation i was feeling before, i might go sit in the park.
