    <div class="body-text">
    <p>december of last year, i smoked my first cigarette. it was a chinese one, a thin with a blueberry-flavored capsule near the filter, but i didn’t know to pop it yet. i had half a pack my friend left with me — he said it didn’t have enough nicotine for him anymore, ‘cause he started smoking peace brand cigarettes. they’re from japan and they come in a tin, and that's how you know you're really in it. he told me there were 28 milligrams of nicotine in every one, or maybe it was tar? i don’t really know how it works, but it sounds poisonous. my cigarette doesn’t light the first 3 times i flick the lighter. it doesn’t light until i can feel the burn through my nails, and then i’m tasting every milligram of whatever carcinogens are in it like it’s been smeared all over my teeth. i run the tip of my tongue over them and i imagine it wiping away the tar like condensation off a bus window when you want to see outside.</p>
    <p>it’s pretty shit, honestly. horrible way to spend christmas if you ask me, but none of the restaurants in <span>new york</span> are open today. so the day feels even shorter and the night twice as dark. even the chinese restaurant is closed. i had nothing left in my fridge, so i was suddenly glad to have my stomach turned. i light a second cigarette even though my clothes had dampened from the snow, by the time i finished the first. </p>
    <p>snow and ash don’t look so different. i wish smoking wasn’t so poetic, because nicotine doesn’t really do anything to me. i think everyone’s just going crazy, and what a cigarette actually does is it forces you to breathe in deep and breathe out fast, and repeat and repeat again, and now you can’t focus on anything else. or maybe we all just really want to go outside like dogs. now i’m imagining every smoker I know lined up behind a giant door, and god is holding the knob and saying, <em>outside? outside?</em>, bent down with one hand on his super holy knee, and we’re all jumping and cheering and barking. then, he opens the door to snow, the type that stretches for miles in all directions, the type that’s all-encompassing, the kind of snow that has people hallucinating in antarctica— snow for miles and miles— and we all rush outside in a flood, and in our wake there’s a trail of ash behind us. </p>
    <p>for about an hour every day everything is bluer than usual. i can tell it’s gonna happen soon, because the porch lights are starting to look extra yellow. i’ve just lit a third cigarette to give my body a reason why i <em>have</em> to stay outside for 5 more minutes. it’s probably not good to chain-smoke like this if you’ve just started smoking. i know it’s bad because i can feel mucus start to build in my throat. sorry if that sounded kind of gross, but it’s true, and my lungs have started to feel like they’re sinking down into my stomach, but that part’s not as bad.</p>
    <p>all of a sudden the front door opens and i’m startled. the front door to my building has a panic exit bar, like fire escape doors or the set of doors that open into the patio. it makes a loud, mechanical crunch and a creak whenever someone comes out here, and that’s why i love opening the door, and i like the noise when i do it, but i’m feeling kind of embarrassed now. i wonder if it was this loud when i did it. regardless, whoever opened the door interrupted me, so i look back, pissed. </p>
    <p>“can i have one?” he says, seeing the unfinished pack in my hands. i look in the box. </p>
    <p>“no,” i say. but he’s kind of hot, so i add, “unless you want to take this one off my hands.” </p>
    <p>i held the cigarette out, and there’s not a lot of it left, so i figured he would say no or yell at me or something. he took the cigarette, turned it around and popped the capsule in it, then put it out in the snow. </p>
    <p>“thanks,” he said. “that’s all i wanted to do.” </p>
    <p>i was suddenly aware of the cold again, and the winter i would be spending mostly alone, so i was a little miffed. </p>
    <p>“…put it out? the fuck? ” </p>
    <p>"yeah",” he said. “you looked cold from my window.”</p>
