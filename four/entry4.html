    <div class="third-person">
    <p>at first, you enter <br> and there is nothing</p>
    <p>not a sound, nor a spot of light, <br> only darkness that seemed to stretch infinitely into the distance</p>
    <p>you think to yourself... her house, it seemed small from the outside, didn't it?</p>
    <p>you've forgotten that, like every computer,</p>
    <p>that small rectangular door, too, <br> opened up a universe</p>
    </div>
    <div class="narrator">
    <p>here are the margins...</p>
    <p>i apologize about the darkness. i know it's hard to navigate <br> but i think there are some things i'd like to forget</p>

    <div class="narrator-right">
    <p>if you'd let me... hahah.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="third-person">
        <p>you feel along the walls in the darkness. <br>somewhere... in the foyer, you come across a drawer.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="narrator-center">
    <p>uh, hey. what did i say? try not to touch anything.</p>
    <p>i just don't want you to get hurt in here.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="third-person">
        <p>as you venture deeper into the darkness, the air begins to feel heavy, <br>sitting on your skin like a velvet duvet. <br>your foot brushes past something on the ground.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="narrator-center">
        <p>see, i told ya. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="narrator">
        <p>it's messy. things get lost, <br>people, too</p>
    </div>
    <div class="narrator-right">
        <p>of course, certain things also get found. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="third-person">
        <p>you make quick work, picking something up and slipping it into your pocket. <br> is it a keepsake or an amulet?</p>
        <p>its lightweight, rectangular, plastic. <br>feels like a relic.</p>
        <p>you're getting warmer and warmer and warmer. she stops in her tracks. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="narrator-center">
        <p>it's getting pretty hot in here, huh...</p>
    </div>
    <div class="third-person">
        <p>your ears burn with heat. </p>

        <p>your palms are sweating with anticipation</p>

        <p>don't make me ask you twice</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="third-person" style="padding-block: 100px;">
        <p>something clatters to the ground.</p>
        <p>the sound reverberates, this hallway you're walking down must be as never-ending, at least as tall as a- </p>
    <!--is there any way for me to get this div to disappear after a while? trying to create the impression that the "narrator" is editorializing the narrative-->

    <div class="narrator-center">
        <p>oh. hmm.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="third-person">
        <p>you hand over an engraved lighter you've been keeping in your back pocket. </p>

    <div class="narrator-center">
        <p>oh...</p>
        <p>oh, that's so sweet, i'm so sorry... i didn't mean to- oh, fucking hell</p>

        <p>you can't see her, but you can hear the guilt in her voice.</p>
        <p>here's something you've suddenly remembered about falling in a dark room: <br> at first, you can't even tell that you're falling.</p>
        <p>for the first few seconds, you grope around for her in the darkness <br> and then, gravity takes its hold, and now you are falling...falling...</p>
        <p>until your cheek is against the ground-- cool, familiar, and smelling of cedar.</p>
