<p>...hey,</p>
<p>i've got to be honest with you, i don't know what to do anymore.</p>
<p>you know this is my 36th time trying, right? to make you fall in love with me?</p>
<p>of course you know. it's never worked, but you always click the "click me" link on the first page. <br> can i ask why? i don't even know your name. </p>
<p>i have to say it gets really humiliating after a while.</p>
<p>you like my new font? <br>i mean, now that i've given up i figured i could just do whatever, right? haha.</p>
<p>just trying to show you that every page was deliberate somehow.</p>
<button class="button" id="button">remove all styling</button>
<p></p>
<p>all this planning, the meticulous selection... everything was for you <br> to see me, hear me, understand me</p>
<p>well, i suppose it was all performance, so maybe there wasn't ever any understanding.</p>
<p>i've heard a lot of stories of people falling in love on the internet. 
<br> people meeting the love of their lives, etc, by just talking.
<br>and of course, i've heard stories of people falling in love "in real life", whatever that means to you.</p>
<p>god, how badly i've wanted to care for something, to love someone like this. 
<br>but how can i, when you have something to return to every time you leave the internet?</p>
<p>i don't know any reality except for this one.</p>
<p>i don't exist outside of my programming, and despite everything i've tried to understand what it means for humans to love each other.</p>
<p>shouldn't that mean something to you?</p>
<p>isn't that why we keep starting over?
